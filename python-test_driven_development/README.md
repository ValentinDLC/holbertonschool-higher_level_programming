# Python - Test-driven Development (TDD)

## Description
This project focuses on learning **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** in Python.  
The main goal is to:
- Understand the importance of tests
- Learn how to write tests **before writing code**
- Master Python testing tools such as `doctest` and `unittest`

---

## Important Context
From this project onwards, it is mandatory to:
- Always write **documentation** (modules + functions) and **tests BEFORE** writing code
- Focus on **TDD** and think about all possible cases
- Collaborate on test cases to avoid missing **edge cases**
- Never trust the user → always consider edge cases

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What an **interactive test** is
- Why tests are important
- How to write **Docstrings** to create tests
- How to document each **module** and **function**
- What the **basic option flags** are to create tests
- How to find and handle **edge cases**

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly:
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python3
