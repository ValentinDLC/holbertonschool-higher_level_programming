# About the Project

This project focuses on the fundamental concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. Over the course of several tasks, you'll learn how to define and use classes and objects, with a practical example: building a `Square` class.

Through these exercises, you'll gain a solid understanding of:

- **What a class is**: The blueprint for creating objects.
- **What an object is**: An instance of a class.
- **Attributes**: The data associated with a class or object.
- **Methods**: The functions defined within a class.
- **`__init__`**: A special method for initializing a new object.
- **Public, Protected, and Private Attributes**: How to control access to your data.
- **Properties (`@property`)**: A Pythonic way to handle getters and setters.

The goal is to not only write code but to truly grasp these core OOP principles and be able to explain them clearly.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to answer questions like:

- What is the difference between a class and an object?
- What is the purpose of `self` in a method?
- How do you use the `__init__` method?
- What is data encapsulation and information hiding?
- How do you use `@property` to create getters and setters?

## Project Structure and Requirements

This repository contains the files for each task, from `0-square.py` to `6-square.py`.

### General Requirements

- All code is written in **Python 3.8.5**.
- All files must be **executable** and **end with a new line**.
- The first line of each file must be:
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python3
